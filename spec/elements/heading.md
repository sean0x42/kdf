# Heading

| Type        | Interface |
| :---------- | :-------- |
| [Linear][1] | Element   |

[1]: ../specification/content.md#linear-content

A section heading, which marks the beginning of a section of text. Heading's are
usually styled to stand out against body text. This may be achieved by
increasing the font size, using a darker colour, increasing the font weight, or
a combination of all three.

## Attributes

### Level

| Required | Type    | Range      |
| :------- | :------ | :--------- |
| Yes      | Integer | `1` to `6` |

The `level` attribute is required for all headings, and may contain any integer
from 1 to 6, where 1 is the highest level and 6 is the lowest. It is
recommended, although not strictly required, for headings to be used without
skipping any levels. In other words, you should always start from level 1, then
2 and so on.
