# Thumbnail

All KDF documents may optionally include a [thumbail][1], which will be shown
in the user's file system. A thumbnail must be either a `png` or `jpg` file,
and should be named `thumbnail.[png|jpg|jpeg]`. The convention is to make the
thumbnail a low resolution view of the first page in the document, but this is
not strictly required.
