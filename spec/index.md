The following is a technical specification for the Kauri Document Format. KDF is
an open source, JSON based document format, that expands and improves over
existing document formats. It has been designed to be used by a document
processor that is currently development, codenamed *Kauri*.

## Features

 - **Everything you expect**: Support for all the document features you know and
   love.
 - **Migrations**: Automatically upgrade KDF documents to be in compliance with
   the latest version of the specification.
 - **Web documents**: Create documents for print or for the web. You can create
   your blogs, technical documentation, and more all in one document format.
 - **Colour palettes**: Create custom colour palettes that follow your documents
   wherever they go.
