::: danger
KDF is currently an experimental document format, and may change suddenly and
without notice at any time. 
:::

The following is a technical specification for the **Kauri Document Format**.
KDF is an open source, JSON based document format, that aims to breath some life
back into your document editing experience. KDF was designed to enable a brand
new document processor that is currently in development, codenamed *Kauri*.


## Features

We've packed many great features into KDF. Here's some highlights:

 - **Everything you expect**: Support for all the document features you know and
   love. Some may still be in development, however.
 - **Migrations**: Functions which automatically upgrade KDF documents to be in
   compliance with the latest version of the specification.
 - **More layout control**: KDF embraces nonlinear layouts, allowing you to
   design the documents of your dreams.
 - **Web & print documents**: Create documents for print or for the web. You can
   create your blogs, technical documentation, and more all in one document
   format.
 - **Colour palettes**: Create custom colour palettes that follow your documents
   wherever they go. Even to other collaborators!
 - **Open source**: KDF is 100% open source. We've built this specification so
   that other application developers can make the most of KDF too.


## Motivation

TODO Discuss why KDF was built, where Office Open XML and the Open Document
Format fall flat. Essentially this should be an essay about the state of the
industry, and how KDF aims to solve some problems, at least in its support of
Kauri.
