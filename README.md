# Kauri Document Format

![GitHub package.json version][1.0]

![Warning: KDF is currently an experimental document format.][1.1]

The following is a technical specification for the **Kauri Document Format**.
KDF is an [open source][1.2], [JSON][1.3] based document format, that aims to
breath some life back into your document editing experience. KDF was designed
to enable a brand new document processor that is currently in development,
codenamed *Kauri*. More on that later.

## Features

We've packed many great features into KDF. Here's some highlights:

 - **Everything you expect**: Support for all the document features you know
   and love. Because KDF is still experimental, some of these features may
   still be in development, however.
 - **Migrations**: Functions which automatically upgrade KDF documents to be in
   compliance with the latest version of the specification.
 - **More layout control**: KDF embraces nonlinear layouts, allowing you to
   design the documents of your dreams.
 - **Web & print documents**: Create documents for print or for the web. You can
   create your blogs, technical documentation, and more all in one document
   format.
 - **Collaboration**: A document format which enables authors to work
   collaboratively on documents. *Coming soon*.
 - **Colour palettes**: Create custom colour palettes that follow your documents
   wherever they go. Even to other collaborators!
 - **Open source**: KDF is 100% open source. We've built this specification so
   that other application developers can make the most of KDF too.
